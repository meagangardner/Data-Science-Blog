It was during this time that I first realized how much the field could benefit from more data experts, which ultimately inspired me to pursue my Master’s.\nComing from a business background prior to my program, my knowledge in the world of Data Science was very minimal, and I had quite a steep learning curve to overcome at the beginning. My hope in creating this blog is to share Data Science concepts and insights in a way that’s accessible to those who, like me, come from a non-technical background but are curious and eager to learn more about this exciting field."
